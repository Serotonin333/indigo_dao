## Examples
Some examples scenarios of a DAO vote to redistribute funds from the IPR include:
ADA in the IPR is used to buy iUSD off of the market to stabilize its peg. Aside from the defacto case of leaving this iUSD in the IPR to be available for traders in the case of a depeg to the upside, some alternatives are.
* The DAO could vote to "trade" this iUSD in the IPR for INDY from emissions to the iUSD stability pool (SP). The iUSD SP would receive iUSD equal in value to their expected INDY emissions while those INDY emissions would instead be rerouted to the DAO Treasury
* The DAO could vote to supply this iUSD on lending protocols to earn additional revenue.
* The DAO could vote to use this iUSD as incentives to liquidity providers (LPs) to incentivize additional spot buying off of the market and deepen liquidity.
